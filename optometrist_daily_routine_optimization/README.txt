(!) Introduction:
  In 2021, I worked full-time at Farmacia Familiei (hereinafter referred to as FF) as a trainee optometrist and at the same time wrote a thesis on the topic
"Effect of spectacle and contact correction on the strength of the oculomotor and ciliary muscles of the eyes in patients without strabismus". As part of my thesis, I collected relevant statistics
October 2021 to May 2022 - 8 months (172 business days) based on FF patients I have examined. In parallel, I collected data on all patients wishing to undergo
diagnostics for issuing contact lines. Although I did not use these data in the final version of my thesis (since they were auxiliary, not targeted (not for demonstration)),
they were useful to me in optimizing the work of FF optometrists, the description and results of which are given below.


(!) Given:
1) In the Republic of Moldova, an optometrist has 247 working days per year, excluding all public holidays (we omit the high year).
2) 247 days * 8 hours = 1976 working hours per year.
3) According to the existing schedule of patients in the FF campaign, the patient is recorded every hour. Therefore, the metric 'time', the metric 'number of patients'
and the metric 'number of one activity performed during a diagnosis', equivalent units for measuring the amount of money a company pays an optometrist.
Therefore, the number of performances of each action of an optometrist per year = the number of working hours in a year = 1976 times / year.
4) The salary of an Optometrist in Moldova is 1050 USD on average.


(!) Problem:
The UML diagrams show that the company is losing a lot of money due to non-optimized work schedules for the optometrist and consultant.


(!) I suggest:
Optimize the work schedules of the optometrist and the consultant in order to make better use of the employees’ work time and increase the company’s income, namely:
Delegate "Assess corneal curvature. Recommend contact lenses." and "Instruct on lens usage and contact lens fittings" from optometrist to consultant because:
(a) it is acceptable (does not contradict) medical standards (corneal curvature assessment in FF is done by a "keratometer" that does not require special medical skills to use).
(b) interpretation of the corneal curvature score is one of the basic knowledge required for a consultant to work at FF, necessary to sell contact lenses to clients.


Note in the Solution:
![A break between patients within 5 minutes is an acceptable time that should not be optimized. This is my personal opinion as an Optometrist and will be considered a postulate in my project.]!


(!) Result:

1) This optimization will allow the campaign to save: 1847,404 USD / year per 1 Optometrist, as it reduces the actual time of the optometrist in 100% of cases to 45 minutes.
2) All 100% of patient appointments will last up to 45 minutes, which will allow you to make an appointment every 50 minutes (instead of 60, as it was before) and, as a result, not 8, but 9 diagnostic sessions / day.
Because 1 diagnostic session costs 14 USD (public information), this optimization will allow the campaign to earn an additional 14 USD * 247 working days = 3458 USD / year per 1 optometrist.
In our company, 7 people work as Optometrists, conducting full-time appointments, therefore:
1) My optimization will save FF: 1847,404 USD * 7 Optometrists = 12931 USD/year in total.
2) My optimization will allow FF to earn: 3458 USD/year * 7 optometrists = 24206 USD/year in total.
+ we should expect from this optimization another increase in revenue from the sale of optics products (glasses, contact lenses ...) from 9 patients
(but I don't have access to information about the average customer check in our company, so I can't forecast the increase in sales and quantify the full benefit of my optometrist optimization in FF).
